            <p class="st">Why did I make this?</p>

            <p>I wrote this essay in early 2019 in response to what I saw as an unquestioning embrace of trendy
                information-literacy pedagogies among fellow teachers and people who write about education. It is
                the first in a series about surviving in a world bereft of epistemological signposts.</p>
            <p>I blog regularly at <a href="https://maxkapur.com/">maxkapur.com</a>, hosted on Blogger, but with
                this site, I wanted to try building everything from scratch. All the CSS is original and the content
                is hosted using <a href="https://github.com/maxkapur/maxkapur.github.io">GitHub Pages</a>. I made a
                custom script in Python with <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful
                    Soup</a> to sanitize
                Word&rsquo;s HTML exports.</p>

            <h3>Update: December 2022</h3>
            <p>
                After finishing grad school, I decided to relearn frontend web dev the &ldquo;right way,&rdquo;and have worked my
                way through most of the lessons <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard">The Odin Project</a>.
                I undertook a major rewrite of the CSS for this site, which uses a proper grid layout with sticky
                positioning. The appearance should now be essentially the same as the original, but with greater consistency
                across browsers and faster load times.
            </p>
            <p>
                I <em>think</em> this rewrite will fix a bunch of bugs, but I probably introduced some new ones in the process,
                so let me know.
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                Of course, as I redid the CSS, I found myself rereading the essay as well, and it&rsquo;s hard to say that my words
                have aged well. &ldquo;How do we learn what&rsquo;s true?&rsquo; is an artifact of a particular cultural moment, in 
                debates over the status of &ldquo;truth&rdquo; felt worthwhile and even urgent. In hindsight, that half-decade in
                which all of us roleplayed as epistemological philosophers was a bit quaint, wasn&rsquo;t it? Perhaps the silver lining
                of 2020, 2021, and 2022 is that we all got to explore the world beyond the high pedestal of meta. 
            </p> -->
